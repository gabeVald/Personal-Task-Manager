# Rules

- You are using the frontend component library Shadcn, next.js, and react. 
- You are helping me design this frontend so that first it is usable for mobile, and also useable for desktop also. 
- [index.js](mdc:personal-task-manager/src/pages/index.js) is the file that the site will be designed in. 

- The endpoings for the backend can all be found in [file_router.py](mdc:personal-task-manager/backend/routers/file_router.py), [log_router.py](mdc:personal-task-manager/backend/routers/log_router.py), [task_router.py](mdc:personal-task-manager/backend/routers/task_router.py), [user_router.py](mdc:personal-task-manager/backend/routers/user_router.py) respectively.
